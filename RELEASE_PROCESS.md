## Overview

This document outlines the complete release management process for iOS and macOS applications, including automated workflows, version management, and deployment procedures.

### Release Types

- **Development Builds**: Internal testing and development
- **Beta Releases**: External testing via TestFlight
- **Production Releases**: App Store distribution
- **Hotfix Releases**: Critical bug fixes
- **Emergency Releases**: Security patches and critical issues

## Release Workflow

### Automated Release Pipeline

The release process is fully automated through GitHub Actions and Fastlane:

    A[Code Merge] --> B[CI Tests]
    B --> C{Manual Trigger or Tag}
    C --> D[Version Bump]
    D --> E[Build App]
    E --> F[Code Signing]
    F --> G[TestFlight Upload]
    G --> H{App Store?}
    H -->|Yes| I[App Store Upload]
    H -->|No| J[GitHub Release]
    I --> J
    J --> K[Notifications]
```

### Release Branches

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **release/x.y.z**: Release preparation branches
- **hotfix/x.y.z**: Critical fixes for production

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or significant feature additions
- **MINOR**: New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Version Bumping

#### Automated Version Bumping
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=patch
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=minor
gh workflow run release.yml -f version_bump=major
```

#### Manual Version Bumping
```bash
# Using Fastlane
bundle exec fastlane ios increment_version type:patch
bundle exec fastlane ios increment_version type:minor
bundle exec fastlane ios increment_version type:major

# Using scripts
./scripts/prepare-release.sh patch
./scripts/prepare-release.sh minor
./scripts/prepare-release.sh major
```

### Build Number Management

Build numbers are automatically incremented based on TestFlight builds:

```bash
# Automatic build number increment
bundle exec fastlane ios increment_build
```

## TestFlight Distribution

### Automated TestFlight Upload

#### Via GitHub Actions
```bash
# Trigger TestFlight deployment
gh workflow run release.yml -f deployment_target=testflight
```

#### Via Fastlane
```bash
# iOS TestFlight
bundle exec fastlane ios beta

# macOS TestFlight
bundle exec fastlane mac beta

# Both platforms
bundle exec fastlane beta_all
```

### Beta Testing Configuration

#### Internal Testing Groups
- **Internal Testers**: Development team
- **QA Team**: Quality assurance testers
- **Product Team**: Product managers and stakeholders

#### External Testing Groups
- **Beta Users**: Selected external testers
- **Power Users**: Advanced users for feedback

### TestFlight Metadata

Update TestFlight release notes in the workflow:

```yaml
changelog: |
  üêõ Bug Fixes:
  - Fixed crash on app launch
  - Resolved memory leak in image processing

  ‚ú® New Features:
  - Added dark mode support
  - Improved performance

  üì± Platform Updates:
  - iOS 17 compatibility
  - New widget support
```

## App Store Deployment

### Automated App Store Submission

#### Via GitHub Actions
```bash
# Deploy to App Store
gh workflow run release.yml -f deployment_target=appstore
```

#### Via Fastlane
```bash
# iOS App Store
bundle exec fastlane ios release

# macOS App Store
bundle exec fastlane mac release
```

### App Store Metadata

#### Metadata Management
- **Fastlane Deliver**: Automated metadata upload
- **Screenshots**: Automated screenshot generation
- **App Store Connect**: Manual review and submission

#### Required Metadata
- App description and keywords
- Screenshots for all device sizes

- [ ] Screenshots represent current app state
- [ ] Testing on all supported devices

#### Submission Process
1. **Automated Upload**: Fastlane uploads build and metadata
2. **Manual Review**: Check App Store Connect for accuracy
3. **Submit for Review**: Initiate Apple's review process
4. **Monitor Status**: Track review progress
5. **Release**: Configure release timing

## Release Automation

### Automated Scripts

#### Release Preparation
```bash
# Prepare release with version bump
./scripts/prepare-release.sh minor

# What it does:
# - Creates release branch
# - Bumps version number
# - Updates changelog
# - Creates pull request
```

#### Post-Release Tasks
```bash
# Post-release cleanup and setup
./scripts/post-release.sh

# What it does:
# - Merges release branch
# - Creates Git tag
# - Updates development branch
# - Sends notifications
```

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Release Workflow (`release.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Git tags, manual dispatch
- **Actions**: Build, test, deploy, create release
- **Outputs**: App binaries, release notes, notifications

#### Version Bump Workflow
```yaml
name: Version Bump
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version_type:
        description: 'Version bump type'
        required: true
        default: 'patch'
        type: choice
        options: [patch, minor, major]
```

### Continuous Deployment

#### Automated Deployment Pipeline
1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes to main branch
2. **CI Tests**: Automated testing pipeline runs
3. **Build**: App is built and signed
4. **TestFlight**: Automatic upload to TestFlight
5. **Notifications**: Team is notified of new build

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Production environment
DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=production
AUTO_DEPLOY_TESTFLIGHT=true
AUTO_DEPLOY_APPSTORE=false

# Staging environment
DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT=staging
AUTO_DEPLOY_TESTFLIGHT=true
AUTO_DEPLOY_APPSTORE=false
```

## Emergency Releases

### Hotfix Process

#### 1. Create Hotfix Branch
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/1.2.3

# Make critical fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix critical security vulnerability"
git push origin hotfix/1.2.3
```

#### 2. Deploy Emergency Release
```bash
# Fast-track deployment
gh workflow run release.yml \
  -f deployment_target=testflight \
  -f version_bump=patch \
  -f emergency=true
```

#### 3. Expedited Review

- **Major Releases**: Monthly or bi-monthly
- **Minor Updates**: Weekly or bi-weekly
- **Patch Releases**: As needed for bug fixes
- **Security Updates**: Immediate deployment

### Risk Management

#### Release Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Major feature releases
- **Medium Risk**: Significant updates
- **Low Risk**: Bug fixes and minor improvements

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Gradual rollout for high-risk releases
- Feature flags for new functionality
- A/B testing for UI changes
- Rollback procedures documented and tested

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clean build environment
bundle exec fastlane clean_all

# Reset code signing
bundle exec fastlane setup_signing

# Rebuild with verbose output
bundle exec fastlane ios build_release --verbose
```

#### TestFlight Upload Failures
