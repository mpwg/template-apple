## Security Response Process

### Severity Classifications

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate risk to users | 24-48 hours | Remote code execution, data breach |
| **High** | Significant security flaw | 1 week | Authentication bypass, privilege escalation |
| **Medium** | Security vulnerability with workaround | 2-4 weeks | Information disclosure, input validation |
| **Low** | Minor security improvement | Next release | Configuration hardening, security headers |

### Response Timeline

3. **Fix Development** (varies by severity)
   - Implement security fix
   - Internal testing and validation
   - Security review

4. **Release and Disclosure**
   - Coordinate fix release
   - Prepare security advisory
   - Public disclosure (after fix is available)

### Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

- **90-day disclosure timeline** for most vulnerabilities
- **Immediate disclosure** for actively exploited issues
- **Coordinated disclosure** with other affected parties if applicable
- **Public recognition** for researchers (with permission)
