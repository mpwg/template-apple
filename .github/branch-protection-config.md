## Branch Protection Rules

### Main Branch Protection

The `main` branch should have the strongest protection as it represents production-ready code.

**Recommended Settings:**
- ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
- ‚úÖ Require approvals (minimum 2 reviewers)
- ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
- ‚úÖ Require review from code owners
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
- ‚úÖ Require signed commits
- ‚ùå Allow force pushes
- ‚ùå Allow deletions

**GitHub CLI Configuration:**
```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["CI/CD Pipeline","Security Scan","SwiftLint","Unit Tests"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"dismiss_stale_reviews":true,"require_code_owner_reviews":true,"required_approving_review_count":2}' \
  --field restrictions='{"users":[],"teams":["maintainers"]}' \
  --field allow_squash_merge=true \
  --field allow_merge_commit=false \
  --field allow_rebase_merge=false
```

**Manual Setup via GitHub Web UI:**
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule** or edit existing rule for `main`
3. Configure as shown above

### Develop Branch Protection

The `develop` branch serves as an integration branch with moderate protection.

**Recommended Settings:**
- ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
- ‚úÖ Require approvals (minimum 1 reviewer)
- ‚ùå Dismiss stale PR approvals (for faster integration)
- ‚ùå Require review from code owners
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚ùå Require conversation resolution (optional)
- ‚úÖ Restrict pushes that create files larger than 100MB
- ‚ùå Require signed commits (optional)
- ‚ùå Allow force pushes (admins only)
- ‚ùå Allow deletions

**GitHub CLI Configuration:**
```bash
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/develop/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["Build and Test","SwiftLint"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=false \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"dismiss_stale_reviews":false,"require_code_owner_reviews":false,"required_approving_review_count":1}' \
  --field restrictions=null \
  --field allow_squash_merge=true \
  --field allow_merge_commit=true \
  --field allow_rebase_merge=true
```

### Release Branch Protection

Release branches need careful handling to ensure stability.

**Recommended Settings:**
- ‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
- ‚úÖ Require approvals (minimum 2 reviewers for main, 1 for develop)
- ‚úÖ Dismiss stale PR approvals when new commits are pushed
- ‚úÖ Require review from code owners
- ‚úÖ Require status checks to pass before merging
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ‚ùå Allow force pushes (admins only)
- ‚ùå Allow deletions

**Pattern-based Protection:**
Use pattern `release/*` to protect all release branches automatically.

### Feature Branch Guidelines

Feature branches typically don't need protection rules, but should follow these guidelines:

**Development Rules:**
- Must branch from `develop`
- Must create PR to merge back to `develop`
- Should pass CI checks before merging
- Can be deleted after successful merge

**Naming Convention:**
- `feature/short-description`
- `feature/issue-123-description`
- `feature/team-name/description`

## Status Checks Configuration

### Required Status Checks

Define status checks that must pass before merging:

**For Main Branch:**
- `CI/CD Pipeline` - Full build and test suite
- `Security Scan` - Security vulnerability scanning
- `SwiftLint` - Code style and quality checks
- `Unit Tests` - All unit tests must pass
- `UI Tests` - Critical UI flows must pass
- `Performance Tests` - Performance regression checks

**For Develop Branch:**
- `Build and Test` - Basic build verification
- `SwiftLint` - Code style checks
- `Unit Tests` - Core functionality tests

**For Feature Branches:**
- `Build Verification` - Ensure code compiles
- `SwiftLint` - Basic style checks

### GitHub Actions Workflows

Configure workflows that provide these status checks:

**`.github/workflows/ci.yml`:**
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: macos-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build and Test
        run: |
          xcodebuild build test

  security-scan:
    name: Security Scan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run security scan
        uses: github/super-linter@v4
```

## Automated Setup

### Repository Setup Script

Create a setup script to automate repository configuration:

**`scripts/setup-repository.sh`:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Repository Setup Script
# Configures branch protection and repository settings

set -e

OWNER="your-org"
REPO="your-repo"

echo "üîß Setting up repository: $OWNER/$REPO"

# Main branch protection
echo "üìù Configuring main branch protection..."
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["CI/CD Pipeline","Security Scan","SwiftLint"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"dismiss_stale_reviews":true,"require_code_owner_reviews":true,"required_approving_review_count":2}' \
  --field restrictions='{"users":[],"teams":["maintainers"]}'

# Develop branch protection
echo "üìù Configuring develop branch protection..."
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/branches/develop/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["Build and Test","SwiftLint"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=false \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1}'

echo "‚úÖ Repository setup completed!"
```

### GitHub Actions Setup

Create workflow files to provide required status checks:

**Basic structure:**
```
.github/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ci.yml          # Main CI/CD pipeline
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ security.yml    # Security scanning
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pr-validation.yml # PR validation checks
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CODEOWNERS          # Code ownership rules
```

### CODEOWNERS File

Define code owners for automatic review assignments:

**`.github/CODEOWNERS`:**
```
# Global owners
* @maintainers-team

# iOS/Swift specific
*.swift @ios-team
*.xcodeproj @ios-team
*.xcworkspace @ios-team

# Fastlane configuration
fastlane/ @release-team
Fastfile @release-team

# CI/CD
.github/ @devops-team
*.yml @devops-team

# Documentation
*.md @documentation-team
docs/ @documentation-team
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Status Check Not Required

**Problem:** PR can be merged even though status check failed

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches**
2. Edit branch protection rule
3. Ensure status check is listed in "Required status checks"
4. Check "Require branches to be up to date"

#### Cannot Bypass Protection as Admin

**Problem:** Admin cannot merge critical hotfix

**Solution:**
1. Temporarily disable "Restrict pushes to matching branches"
2. Or use "Dismiss stale reviews" and get fresh approval
3. Re-enable protection after merge

#### Status Check Never Completes

**Problem:** Required status check stuck in "Expected" state

**Solution:**
1. Check GitHub Actions workflow logs
2. Verify workflow is triggered by the correct events
3. Ensure workflow name matches required status check name
4. Re-run failed workflows if needed

#### Team Permissions Not Working

**Problem:** Team members cannot perform expected actions

**Solution:**
1. Verify team membership in organization settings
2. Check team permissions on repository
3. Ensure branch protection allows team access
4. Verify organization 2FA requirements are met

### Best Practices

1. **Start with Basic Protection**
   - Implement minimal viable protection first
   - Gradually add more restrictions as needed

2. **Test Protection Rules**
   - Use test repository to verify settings
   - Test with different user permission levels

3. **Monitor and Adjust**
   - Review protection effectiveness regularly
   - Adjust rules based on team feedback

4. **Document Changes**
   - Keep this document updated
   - Communicate changes to team

5. **Backup Configuration**
   - Export settings before major changes
   - Use Infrastructure as Code when possible
